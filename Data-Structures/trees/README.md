# Trees

A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.

## Challenge 15

- Create a Binary Search Tree that has Add and Contains methods
- Add
  - Arguments: value
  - Return: nothing
  - Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
- Contains
  - Argument: value
  - Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Approach & Efficiency

### Depth First

- Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root. Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

- Pre-order: root >> left >> right
- In-order: left >> root >> right
- Post-order: left >> right >> root

### Big O in Trees

- The Big O time complexity of a Binary Search Tree’s insertion and search operations is O(h), or O(height). In the worst case, we will have to search all the way down to a leaf, which will require searching through as many nodes as the tree is tall. In a balanced (or “perfect”) tree, the height of the tree is log(n). In an unbalanced tree, the worst case height of the tree is n.

### Binary Search Trees

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.

## API

- Pre-order: root >> left >> right
- In-order: left >> root >> right
- Post-order: left >> right >> root
- Add
  - Arguments: value
  - Return: nothing
  - Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
- Contains
  - Argument: value
  - Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
